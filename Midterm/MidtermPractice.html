                For anyone who isn't familiar with user interface (UI) design, our team is responsible for communicating game systems to the player and providing players with the inputs they need to ingage with those systems. So while we are focused on helping the player achieve what they want to do, we also need to balance that goal against the vision for the game while maintaining the clarity of what our interface is trying to communicate.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you might imagine, this means that we iterate on our UI regularly. As systems change, the UI changes with it, which can in turn cause player goals to change. The UI then needs to adapt while keeping our visual language consistent across the entire game. Visual polish is one of the last things we focus on for this reason. Please keep that in mind as we talk through and show some of our in-progress work, but feel free to let us know your thoughts!

                We saw a lot of feedback around the inventory, either regarding its coloring, the styly/size of the item icons, or overall aesthetic. To avoidinterrupting gameplay with pockets of inventory management, we're not planning on bringing back different-sized items. Howeber, we've been tackling the other points from a variety of directions. With item icons, we'd initially pursued a painterly style to stay in line with the overall art direction of the game, and we're finding that it doesn't come across as well when we're talkinga bout small elements in the UI. We're now exploring another approach more directly based off of the 3D models to give them natural texture and realism.
