             About me:
         </p>

        <p>
            I’m a post-bachelor, non-traditional Computer Science major at Weber State University. More than a decade ago, I earned a Bachelor of Art in English Literature—with an emphasis in creative non-fiction writing, and a minor in Spanish—at this same university.
            And, yes, it’s just as marketable as it sounds (read: not marketable).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In the twelve years that have passed since I graduated with my first degree, I’ve spent quite a bit of my spare time devoted to learning everything I could about tech, computers, and coding. I quickly realized that I got my degree in the wrong thing. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Just before fall semester of 2019, my restraint broke. I determined that I would dedicate the thirty plus years of my remaining career toward software engineering, where I belong. I began classes 4 days after my epiphany and have been slaving away toward my Computer Science degree ever since. I expect to graduate December of 2021.
        </p>

        <p>
            My favorite projects to work on are those that require analytical thinking and puzzling out the logistics to create interesting functionality. I would love to work in a scientifically forward environment where I can learn new things and find solutions to complex problems. I thrive in mentally challenging environments.
         </p>

        <p>
            In my personal life, I’ve been married for thirteen years and I have three kids to show for it—ages twelve, ten, and five. By day I work as a mortgage loan originator. I’ve spent most of my working years in the finance industry which has fortified my analytical and problem-solving skills, and my attention to detail.
